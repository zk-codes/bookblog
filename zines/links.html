        <h1>Resources &amp; Archives</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This is your directory to the infrastructure of zine culture—where to find zines, where to learn more, where to donate your own work, and what tools and communities exist to support zine-making. Resources change constantly as organizations fold, websites disappear, and new projects emerge. Consider this a snapshot that will require updating, but these are the major players and institutions as of 2025.</p>

    <section class="warning">
        <strong>Note on Link Rot:</strong> The internet is ephemeral. Websites disappear, URLs change, projects end. If a resource listed here is no longer active when you're reading this, that's the nature of DIY culture and the internet. Search for current alternatives, ask in zine communities, or check the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine for historical information.

    <p>These institutions collect, preserve, and provide access to zines. Many lend zines like regular libraries. Others are reference collections where you can read but not check out. Supporting them (through donations of zines or money) helps preserve zine culture.</p>
