        <h1>Glossary</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Zine culture has its own vocabulary—jargon, slang, technical terms, and subcultural language. This glossary defines the terms you'll encounter in zines, at zine fests, and in zine communities. Some terms are technical, some are cultural, some are both. Knowing the language helps you participate in the culture, but don't let unfamiliar terms intimidate you—zine culture is welcoming to newcomers who ask questions.</p>

    <section class="aside">
        <strong>Aside: Language Evolution</strong>
        Like all living language, zine terminology changes. New terms emerge, old terms fall out of use, meanings shift. This glossary reflects usage as of the mid-2020s, but language will continue evolving. When in doubt, ask zinesters what they mean by a term—definitions aren't always universal.
    </section>

    <h2>General Zine Terms</h2>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Zine</strong> (rhymes with "bean" or "fine," both pronunciations are common)<br>
        Short for magazine or fanzine. A self-published, small-circulation publication, usually photocopied and DIY in aesthetic. Can be about anything, in any format, as long as it's independently produced and distributed outside commercial channels. <a href="history-culture.html">See History &amp; Culture for origins</a>.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Zinester</strong><br>
        A person who makes zines. The term emphasizes the activity and identity of zine-making. Some people prefer "zine maker" as less scene-y, but "zinester" is widely used and understood.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Fanzine</strong><br>
        The original term: fan magazine. Zines created by fans about topics they're enthusiastic about—originally science fiction, later music, then expanded to any topic-focused zine. "Zine" evolved from "fanzine" but now has broader meaning. <a href="history-culture.html">See History &amp; Culture</a>.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Perzine</strong><br>
        Personal zine. A zine focused on the creator's own life, experiences, thoughts, and observations rather than on an external topic. The dominant form of contemporary zines. <a href="types-genres.html">More in Types &amp; Genres</a>.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Issue</strong><br>
        A single publication in an ongoing series. "Issue 5" means the fifth zine in a continuing publication. Some zines are one-shots (single issues), others are ongoing series.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>One-Shot</strong><br>
        A zine intended as a standalone publication rather than part of an ongoing series. Many zines are one-shots—made once, about a specific topic or project, not intended to continue.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Mini-Zine</strong><br>
        A small zine, typically quarter-size or smaller. Often refers specifically to the one-page/eight-page folded format. Quick to make, cheap to produce, good for beginners. <a href="technical-reference.html">See Technical Reference for folding instructions</a>.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Half-Size</strong><br>

    <h2>Production and Technical Terms</h2>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Cut-and-Paste Layout</strong><br>
        Literal cutting and pasting—physically cutting text and images and gluing them onto pages to create layouts. The traditional zine production method before digital design became common. Still used by many zinesters for its tactile quality and DIY aesthetic.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Master Copy</strong><br>
        The original version of each page that you photocopy to make your print run. You create one master copy of the entire zine, then reproduce it.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Saddle Stitch</strong><br>
        Binding method using staples through the spine of nested, folded pages. The standard zine binding. Called "saddle" stitch because the zine sits over the stapler like a saddle. <a href="technical-reference.html">See Technical Reference for details</a>.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Perfect Binding</strong><br>
        Binding method where pages are glued together at the spine, like a paperback book. Used for longer zines where stapling won't work. Requires special equipment or professional printing.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Colophon</strong><br>
        Information about the zine's production—when and where it was made, print run size, tools used, etc. Often included at the end of art zines and more formal publications. Optional but nice for documentation.
    </section>

    <h2>Distribution and Community Terms</h2>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Distro</strong><br>
        Short for distributor. A person or organization that sells zines on behalf of creators, usually taking a percentage of sales. Distros help zinesters reach audiences without handling all logistics themselves. <a href="scenes-distribution.html">See Scenes &amp; Distribution</a>.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Consignment</strong><br>

        <strong>Zine Fest</strong><br>
        An event where zinesters gather to sell, trade, and celebrate zines. Can range from a dozen tables to hundreds. Usually includes tabling space, often includes workshops, readings, or other programming. <a href="scenes-distribution.html">More in Scenes &amp; Distribution</a>.

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Tabling</strong><br>
        Setting up a table at a zine fest or other event to sell or trade your zines. "I'm tabling at the zine fest next month" means you've reserved a table space to display your work.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Trade</strong><br>
        Exchanging zines with other zinesters rather than buying/selling. A common practice that builds community and collections. "Want to trade?" is a frequent question at zine fests and in zine circles.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Scene</strong><br>
        A network of people making, reading, and distributing zines, often in a specific geographic location or around a specific interest. "The Portland zine scene" or "the punk zine scene." <a href="scenes-distribution.html">See Scenes &amp; Distribution</a>.
    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>DIY</strong><br>
        Do It Yourself. The philosophy underlying zine culture: don't wait for permission or institutions, just make things yourself. Also describes the aesthetic of self-made, imperfect, handcrafted cultural production.

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>SASE</strong><br>

    </section>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>Sellout</strong><br>

    <section class="term-entry">
        <strong>In The Mail / ITM</strong><br>

    <section class="aside">
        <strong>Aside: Using This Vocabulary</strong>
        Don't feel pressure to use all this terminology. Much of it emerges naturally as you participate in zine culture. Some people embrace the jargon, others avoid it as too insider-y. Use language that feels natural to you. The best zine communities welcome people regardless of how fluent they are in zine-speak. Asking "what does that mean?" is always acceptable and usually welcomed.
