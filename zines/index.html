    <section class="manifesto">
        <p>Welcome to the Zine-o-pedia, where we've taken the beautiful chaos of zine culture and organized it into something resembling coherence without sucking out all the soul. This isn't your typical encyclopedia full of lifeless stubs and academic detachment. This is a living document about a living medium that's been kicking around in various forms for centuries, refusing to die despite every prediction to the contrary.</p>
        
        <p>Zines are photocopied manifestos, hand-stapled poetry, cut-and-paste rage, carefully crafted art objects, and everything in between. They're what happens when people decide the gatekeepers can go to hell and make their own culture, thank you very much. From punk rockers documenting their scenes to riot grrrls starting revolutions to lonely teenagers realizing they're not alone, zines have been the medium of choice for anyone who has something to say and doesn't want to wait for permission.</p>
        
        <p>Each page here is dense with information, cross-referenced like a conspiracy theorist's bulletin board, and written with the understanding that you're smart enough to handle nuance and contradiction. Dive in anywhere. Get lost. Learn something. Make a zine about it.</p>
