        <h1>Notable Zines &amp; Creators</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This is not a comprehensive list—that would be impossible and probably boring. These are zines that mattered, that influenced culture, that changed how people thought about self-publishing, or that were just so good they deserve recognition. They're organized roughly by era and movement, because zines don't exist in isolation—they're part of conversations and communities. Some of these zines are still available in archives and libraries. Some are lost to history except in people's memories and scattered collections. All of them prove that self-publishing can be as important as anything coming out of establishment presses.</p>

    <section class="aside">
        <strong>Aside: On Canonization</strong>
        Making a list of "important" zines is inherently problematic. It creates a canon, and canons tend to center the work of people who already had the most visibility—often white, often male, often from urban centers. Thousands of vital zines were made by people who never got written up in mainstream media, whose work was too personal or too localized to circulate widely, or who were working in communities that historians have ignored. This list includes well-documented zines because that's what we can write about with authority, but know that it's incomplete by design.

    <h2>The Foundational Era: Science Fiction Fanzines</h2>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>The Comet</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1930 | Science Correspondence Club | Chicago</p>
        <p>Generally credited as the first science fiction fanzine, <em>The Comet</em> was published by the Science Correspondence Club and edited by Raymond A. Palmer (who would later edit <em>Amazing Stories</em>). It was mimeographed—a pre-photocopier duplication technology—and distributed to club members. It set the template: fans talking to fans, creating community around shared interests that mainstream culture dismissed as worthless.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Xero</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1960-1963 | Dick Lupoff & Pat Lupoff | New York</p>
        <p>By the 1960s, SF fanzines had evolved into sophisticated publications. <em>Xero</em> won multiple Hugo Awards (yes, fanzines have their own Hugo category) and featured writing by Harlan Ellison, James Blish, and other major SF figures before they were famous. It showed that amateur publishing could be as good as—sometimes better than—professional venues.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>The Punk Explosion: Music and Attitude</h2>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Sniffin' Glue</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1976-1977 | Mark Perry | London</p>
        <p>The zine that launched a thousand photocopiers. Mark Perry started <em>Sniffin' Glue</em> after seeing the Ramones play in London in July 1976. It was crude, immediate, and completely unprofessional—exactly what punk needed. The famous three-chord diagram that said "This is a chord. This is another. This is a third. Now form a band" applied equally to making zines: you don't need expertise, just enthusiasm. It ran for 12 issues and proved that fans could document their own culture in real time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Punk Magazine</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1976-1979 | John Holmstrom, Legs McNeil, Ged Dunn | New York</p>
        <p>Started the same year as <em>Sniffin' Glue</em>, <em>Punk Magazine</em> took a different approach—more professional design, comics, humor, and a self-aware sense of its own importance. Legs McNeil's writing defined a certain kind of punk attitude: bored, ironic, too cool to care. It captured CBGB-era New York punk with insider knowledge and outsider snark.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Maximum Rocknroll</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1982-present | Tim Yohannan (founder), collective | San Francisco</p>
        <p>If there's one zine that defines hardcore punk, it's <em>Maximum Rocknroll</em>. Started as a radio show, it became a zine in 1982 and has published continuously since. It's been the bible of international punk and hardcore, documenting every scene, every band, every controversy. It's also been politically radical and occasionally dogmatic—founder Tim Yohannan had strong opinions about what punk should be, and not everyone agreed. But its importance is undeniable. It's outlived most of the bands it covered and continues to function as a collectively-run, non-profit venture. <a href="history-culture.html">See History &amp; Culture for more context</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="box">
        <h3>The Great MRR Controversy</h3>
        <p><em>Maximum Rocknroll</em> famously refused to review records by bands on major labels or bands that charged more than a certain amount for admission. This hardline DIY stance inspired some and infuriated others. The debates about punk purity, sellouts, and authenticity that raged in <em>MRR</em>'s letters section in the 1980s and '90s were formative for thousands of kids figuring out their politics and ethics. Whether you agreed or not, <em>MRR</em> made you think about what you stood for.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Flipside</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1977-2000 | Al Kowalewski (Flipside) | Los Angeles</p>
        <p>The LA punk counterpart to <em>MRR</em>, but less political and more eclectic. <em>Flipside</em> covered hardcore, but also skateboarding, art, whatever interested the editors. It was important for documenting the West Coast scene and for being more inclusive than some other punk zines—less concerned with ideological purity, more interested in what was interesting.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>The Personal Revolution: Perzines and Riot Grrrl</h2>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Cometbus</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1981-present | Aaron Cometbus | Berkeley/various</p>
        <p>Aaron Cometbus started his zine at age 15 and has published over 60 issues. Early issues were punk scene reports, but over time it evolved into something more literary—long-form personal essays, travel writing, working-class stories, all in Cometbus's distinctive voice. He types everything on a typewriter, and his prose has influenced countless perzine writers. Issues sell thousands of copies, proving that personal writing can find a wide audience if it's good enough. <a href="types-genres.html">More on perzines in Types &amp; Genres</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Dishwasher</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1989-2000 | Pete Jordan | Various locations</p>
        <p>Pete Jordan set a goal to wash dishes in all 50 states, and he documented the quest in his zine <em>Dishwasher</em>. It was funny, self-deprecating, and oddly inspiring—here was someone creating an adventure out of minimum-wage work. The zine got mainstream media coverage (which Jordan was ambivalent about) and proved that you could make a compelling zine about seemingly mundane things if you had a good enough perspective.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Bikini Kill</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1990-1992 | Kathleen Hanna, Tobi Vail, Kathi Wilcox | Olympia, WA</p>
        <p>The zine that helped launch riot grrrl. It was raw, angry, feminist, and unapologetic. Kathleen Hanna's writing confronted sexism in punk, sexual violence, body image, and the experience of being young and female and furious. The zine functioned as both manifesto and community-building tool—it told young women that they weren't alone in their anger and gave them language for their experiences. It also named the band that would become riot grrrl icons.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Girl Germs</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1990-1996 | Jen Smith, Allison Wolfe, Molly Neuman | Various locations</p>
        <p>Another foundational riot grrrl zine, <em>Girl Germs</em> mixed personal writing, politics, interviews, and cut-and-paste aesthetics. It was created by members of the band Bratmobile and emphasized both DIY production and revolutionary content. The name itself was reclaiming a schoolyard insult—exactly the kind of move that defined riot grrrl's approach to language and power.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Jigsaw</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1992-1996 | Various editors | Washington, DC</p>
        <p>A collectively-produced riot grrrl zine that came out of the DC scene. <em>Jigsaw</em> was more explicitly political than some other riot grrrl zines, addressing racism, classism, and intersectionality in ways that the broader movement sometimes failed to do. It's a reminder that riot grrrl was never monolithic—there were internal debates and different perspectives from the beginning.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="footnote">
        <strong>Footnote on Riot Grrrl's Archive Problem:</strong> Many riot grrrl zines were intensely personal and dealt with trauma, abuse, and other sensitive topics. Some creators later had complicated feelings about having their teenage writings preserved and circulated. This creates an ethical tension in zine archives—do you preserve everything for historical value, or do you respect creators' wishes to have certain work disappear? There's no easy answer, but it's worth thinking about when we discuss "important" personal zines.

    <h2>The Weird, the Transgressive, the Controversial</h2>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Answer Me!</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1991-1994 | Jim Goad, Debbie Goad | Portland, OR</p>
        <p>Possibly the most controversial zine ever published. <em>Answer Me!</em> was deliberately offensive, transgressive, and confrontational. It published interviews with serial killers, explorations of taboo topics, and content designed to shock. The final issue, focused on rape, was so controversial that distributors refused to carry it and copies were seized. Whether <em>Answer Me!</em> was fearless truth-telling or just nihilistic provocation is still debated. It definitely pushed boundaries—whether those boundaries needed pushing is the question.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="aside">
        <strong>Aside: When Transgression Becomes Abuse</strong>
        Jim Goad was later convicted of assaulting his partner Debbie Goad. This complicates the legacy of <em>Answer Me!</em>—was its transgressive content connected to actual harm, or was it performance? This is a recurring problem with "edgy" culture: sometimes the pose of transgression masks or enables real violence. It's worth remembering that shock value isn't the same as insight, and cruelty isn't the same as honesty.
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Temp Slave!</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1993-1998 | Keffo | Madison, WI</p>
        <p>A zine about the indignities of temp work in the 1990s economy. <em>Temp Slave!</em> collected horror stories from temporary workers, offered workplace sabotage tips (only semi-joking), and articulated a class consciousness that was rare in zine culture. It resonated with a generation doing precarious labor and feeling like the economy had betrayed them. It was funny, angry, and politically sharp.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>The Literary and Art Zines</h2>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>The East Village Inky</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1998-2008 | Ayun Halliday | New York</p>
        <p>A perzine focused on Halliday's life as a mother and artist in New York. It was illustrated throughout with her distinctive drawings, mixing mundane domestic details with larger observations about parenting, creativity, and urban life. It proved that you could make a zine about ordinary life and make it compelling through good writing and unique perspective.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Mend My Dress</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">2003-2011 | Alicia Policia | New York</p>
        <p>A beautifully designed poetry and art zine that elevated zine production to fine art. Each issue was hand-stitched, included original art, and featured poetry from emerging and established writers. It existed at the intersection of DIY zine culture and art book production, showing that these worlds could merge.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="box">
        <h3>The Rise of the Art Zine</h3>
        <p>In the 2000s and 2010s, art zines became increasingly prominent. Artists used the zine format for affordable limited-edition works—cheaper than prints, more tangible than digital files, more accessible than gallery shows. Risograph printing technology made full-color art zines feasible for small runs. Art schools started including zine-making in their curricula. The art zine scene has its own ecosystem now, with dedicated fests, publishers, and collectors. <a href="types-genres.html">See Types &amp; Genres for more on art zines</a>.</p>

    <h2>Community-Specific Zines</h2>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Holy Titclamps</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1989-1994 | Larry-bob Roberts | San Francisco</p>
        <p>A queer punk zine that documented the intersection of LGBTQ+ culture and punk/alternative scenes. <em>Holy Titclamps</em> covered queercore bands, interviewed LGBTQ+ artists and activists, and created space for queer perspectives in punk culture. It was part of a broader wave of queer zines in the late '80s and '90s that built community and visibility.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Bamboo Girl</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1995-2001 | Sabrina Margarita Alcantara-Tan | San Francisco</p>
        <p>A zine by and for Asian American women, addressing identity, culture, racism, and the particular experiences of growing up Asian in America. <em>Bamboo Girl</em> challenged the whiteness of much mainstream alternative culture and created representation where there was little. It evolved from photocopied zine to glossy magazine, then back to zine format.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Maximumrocknroll's "Scene Reports"</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1982-present | Various contributors | Worldwide</p>
        <p>While not a standalone zine, the Scene Reports section of <em>MRR</em> functioned as micro-zines within the zine. Contributors from around the world would write about their local punk scenes—what bands were playing, what venues existed, what the local politics were. These reports created a global map of punk culture and made isolated kids realize they weren't alone. Many people's first published writing was a scene report.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="footnote">
        <strong>Footnote on Representation:</strong> One of zines' great strengths has been giving voice to marginalized communities. When mainstream media ignores you, you make your own media. Queer zines, zines by people of color, disability zines, working-class zines, zines from the Global South—all have used the format to speak truths that weren't being heard elsewhere. Any list of "important" zines needs to acknowledge this diversity, even if historical documentation is incomplete.

    <h2>The Infrastructure Zines</h2>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Factsheet Five</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1982-1998 | Mike Gunderloy (1982-1991), R. Seth Friedman (1991-1998) | Various locations</p>
        <p>Not a zine about a topic, but a zine about zines. <em>Factsheet Five</em> reviewed hundreds of zines per issue, providing descriptions and ordering information. Before the internet, it was the primary discovery mechanism for zine culture. If you wanted to know what zines existed, you read <em>F5</em>. Mike Gunderloy reviewed an estimated 30,000 zines during his tenure as editor, an almost superhuman feat. When it folded in 1998, it was partly because the internet had made its function obsolete. <a href="history-culture.html">More context in History &amp; Culture</a>.</p>

        <p class="zine-meta">1999, 2003 (expanded edition) | Alex Wrekk | Portland, OR</p>
        <p>A how-to guide for making zines, distributed as a zine. It covered everything from layout to distribution, written in an encouraging, accessible style. The expanded second edition became <em>the</em> reference guide for beginning zinesters in the 2000s. It demystified the process and encouraged thousands of people to try making their own zines. <a href="making-zines.html">This entire page owes a debt to <em>Stolen Sharpie Revolution</em></a>.</p>

    <h2>Contemporary and Ongoing Zines</h2>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Razorcake</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">2001-present | Todd Taylor, Sean Carswell | Los Angeles</p>
        <p>When <em>Flipside</em> ended, some of its contributors started <em>Razorcake</em> to continue documenting DIY punk culture. It's been published continuously since 2001, adapting to changes in music and culture while maintaining its commitment to underground and independent scenes. It's proof that print punk zines can still thrive in the digital age.</p>

    <section class="zine-entry">
        <h3>Broken Pencil</h3>
        <p class="zine-meta">1995-present | Various editors | Toronto, Canada</p>
        <p>Billed as "the magazine of zine culture and the independent arts," <em>Broken Pencil</em> reviews zines, comics, and DIY media while also publishing longer articles about zine culture. It's evolved from zine to glossy magazine to online publication, serving as a bridge between zine culture and broader alternative media.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="aside">
        <strong>Aside: The Difficulty of Contemporary Assessment</strong>
        It's hard to know which current zines will be considered "important" in 20 years. Some brilliant work is happening right now in obscurity, and some heavily-promoted zines might be forgotten. The zines that last are often the ones that get preserved in archives, collected by dedicated fans, or documented by researchers—which means we're always working with incomplete information. The most important zine being made right now might be sitting in someone's bedroom in a small town, being traded among 15 people, never making it into any archive.
    </section>

    <h2>Why These Zines Matter</h2>

    <p>Looking at this list, some patterns emerge. The zines that get remembered tend to be the ones that either documented important cultural moments, articulated ideas that weren't being expressed elsewhere, built lasting communities, or demonstrated what the medium could do.</p>

    <p>But here's the thing about "notable" zines: their notability is partly accident. <em>Sniffin' Glue</em> is famous partly because it was genuinely groundbreaking, but also partly because it was in the right place at the right time, because Mark Perry was a good self-promoter, because London punk got more media attention than punk in other cities. Dozens of equally vital zines from the same era are forgotten because they weren't as well-connected or because copies didn't survive or because they were made by people whose work historians haven't valued.</p>

    <p>Every zine listed here was made by someone who decided their voice mattered enough to reproduce it and share it. That act of self-assertion is what makes zines important, whether or not they make it into the canon. The zine you make in your bedroom tonight might not be historically significant, but it's significant to you and to whoever reads it. That's enough.</p>

    <section class="box">
        <h3>Finding These Zines</h3>
        <p>Many of these zines are archived in libraries and special collections. The New York Public Library, Barnard Zine Library, Saltydog Zine Library in Portland, and many others have significant zine holdings. Some are digitized and available online through zine archives. Some are still available for purchase from the creators or from zine distros. And some are truly rare—only existing in a few collections, occasionally showing up on eBay for ridiculous prices. <a href="resources-archives.html">See Resources &amp; Archives for where to find zines</a>.</p>
