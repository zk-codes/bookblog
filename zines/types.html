        <h1>Types &amp; Genres</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Trying to categorize zines is like trying to categorize human expression—you can create broad categories, but the best examples always break the rules and blur the boundaries. These classifications are descriptive, not prescriptive. Your zine doesn't need to fit neatly into a category to be valid. That said, understanding the landscape helps you figure out where your work fits and what traditions you're drawing on (or rejecting).</p>

    <section class="aside">
        <strong>Aside: Categories Are Made Up</strong>
        These genre distinctions didn't exist at the beginning—they emerged as zine culture developed and people needed language to describe what they were making. Many of the best zines ignore genre entirely or combine multiple genres. If you make a perzine that's also an art zine that's also political, great. Categories are tools for discussion, not straitjackets.
    </section>

    <h2>Perzines</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Perzines (personal zines) focus on the creator's own life, thoughts, experiences, and observations. They're the zine equivalent of memoir, diary, or personal essay. The content can be mundane (what you did this week) or profound (processing trauma, exploring identity), but the defining feature is that the creator's personal experience is the subject.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common elements:</strong> First-person narratives, reflections on daily life, relationship stories, travel experiences, philosophical musings, intimate confessions, humor about personal failures.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To process experiences, connect with others who relate, create a record of their lives, figure out who they are through writing, combat isolation, or just because they have stories to tell.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Perzines became prominent in the 1990s, particularly through riot grrrl culture, but the impulse is older—many punk zines had personal elements. What changed was making the personal the <em>point</em> rather than a side element.</p>

    <p>The best perzines balance honesty with craft. They're personal without being solipsistic, intimate without being exhibitionist. They assume readers will care about the creator's life because of how that life is rendered, not because the life itself is inherently fascinating.</p>

    <section class="footnote">
        <strong>Footnote on Privilege and Perzines:</strong> There's an uncomfortable truth that personal narrative is more accessible to some people than others. If you're relatively safe and secure, writing honestly about your life feels liberating. If you're in a precarious situation—living with unsupportive family, in a dangerous environment, in a marginalized community—that same honesty could have serious consequences. This is why some critics argue perzines historically centered privileged perspectives. It's worth considering who gets to be personal publicly and who doesn't.
    </section>

    <section class="box">
        <h3>Famous Perzines</h3>
        <p><em>Cometbus</em> (Aaron Cometbus) is the canonical example—decades of personal narrative combined with scene documentation and political awareness. <em>Dishwasher</em> (Pete Jordan) turned the mundane into adventure. <em>The East Village Inky</em> (Ayun Halliday) chronicled motherhood and creativity. <a href="notable-zines.html">See Notable Zines for more examples</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Music Zines</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Zines about music—covering scenes, reviewing albums and shows, interviewing bands, documenting subcultures, arguing about what punk/metal/hip-hop/whatever really means. Music zines were the original zines for many people, predating even science fiction fanzines if you count 19th-century music journalism.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common elements:</strong> Show reviews, album reviews, band interviews, scene reports, photos from concerts, arguments about genre definitions, tour diaries.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To document scenes that mainstream media ignores, to participate in musical communities, to argue passionately about bands they love or hate, to create historical records, because they care about music more than any other single thing.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Punk zines especially established the template: partisan, opinionated, written by fans for fans, suspicious of corporate music and mainstream success. <em>Maximum Rocknroll</em>, <em>Flipside</em>, <em>Razorcake</em> are the long-runners, but countless smaller music zines have documented every subgenre and regional scene imaginable. <a href="notable-zines.html">More on music zines in Notable Zines &amp; Creators</a>.</p>

    <p>Music zines have faced challenges in the digital era—music blogs and social media can provide the same information faster and free. But physical music zines persist because they offer depth, curation, and physical objects that fans value.</p>

    <h2>Political Zines</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Zines focused on political ideas, activism, social change, theory, or critique. They range from single-issue advocacy (animal rights, abortion access, prison abolition) to broader ideological perspectives (anarchism, feminism, environmentalism) to specific campaigns or movements.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common elements:</strong> Political theory, calls to action, analyses of current events, how-to guides for activism, critiques of systems and structures, manifestos, radical history.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To spread ideas, educate and organize, counter mainstream narratives, preserve radical history, build movements, articulate visions of different worlds.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Political zines have deep roots—pamphlets and broadsides have always been tools of political movements. The punk connection gave political zines a specific aesthetic and distribution network, but political zines exist across the spectrum from reformist to revolutionary, single-issue to systemic.</p>

    <p>The best political zines combine passion with analysis, avoiding both dry theory and empty sloganeering. They're accessible without being simplistic, radical without being dogmatic. The worst political zines are either incomprehensible theory-speak or shallow calls to action without substance.</p>

    <section class="aside">
        <strong>Aside: Security Culture and Political Zines</strong>
        Some political zines deal with legally gray or outright illegal activities—direct action, property destruction, evading surveillance. These zines navigate interesting tensions: they need to be instructive enough to be useful but vague enough to not constitute conspiracy or incitement. They need to reach audiences but protect both creators and readers. This is why many political zines use pseudonyms and are distributed carefully within trusted networks.
    </section>

    <h2>Literary Zines</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Zines that publish creative writing—poetry, fiction, essays, experimental prose. They're the DIY equivalent of literary magazines, but less bound by convention and more open to work that wouldn't fit traditional publishing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common elements:</strong> Poems, short stories, flash fiction, prose poetry, lyric essays, experimental text pieces, occasionally accompanying artwork.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To publish writing outside academic or commercial literary scenes, to create space for writing that doesn't fit mainstream taste, to build literary community, because they love literature and want to participate in creating it.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Literary zines occupy an interesting space between high culture and DIY culture. Some literary zinesters come from academic backgrounds but reject the insularity of academic publishing. Others have no formal training but love language and writing. The best literary zines are unpretentious about their literariness—they care about good writing, not credentials.</p>

    <p>Poetry zines especially have thrived—poetry is short, so you can fit several poems in a small zine, and poetry has always had an uneasy relationship with commercial publishing. Many contemporary poets started in zines and still publish zine work alongside more "legitimate" publications.</p>

    <h2>Art Zines</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Zines where visual art is the primary content. They can be collections of one artist's work, themed anthologies, experimental visual projects, or anything where the image is more important than the text. Art zines exploded with the availability of affordable color printing, especially risograph.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common elements:</strong> Illustrations, prints, photographs, collage, graphic design pieces, visual experiments, sometimes minimal or no text.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To create affordable art multiples, to experiment with printing and reproduction, to reach audiences outside gallery systems, to make art accessible, because the zine format suits their artistic practice.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Art zines have increasingly professionalized—they're often called "artist books" when they're fancy enough, and there's a whole art book fair circuit. But the DIY spirit remains: art zines democratize visual art, making it available to people who can't afford gallery prices or access art world spaces.</p>

    <section class="box">
        <h3>The Risograph Revolution</h3>
        <p>Risograph printing transformed art zines. The distinctive aesthetic—flat colors, slight misregistration, limited color palettes—became hugely popular in the 2010s. Risograph makes color printing affordable for small runs while producing images that look intentionally artistic rather than cheap. Many art zinesters now design specifically for risograph's capabilities and limitations. <a href="making-zines.html">More on risograph in Making Zines</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Comic Zines</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Zines that are primarily comics—sequential art telling stories or expressing ideas visually. They overlap with art zines but are distinguished by their narrative or sequential nature. Comic zines have a long history parallel to but distinct from mainstream comics.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common elements:</strong> Multi-panel comics, graphic stories, illustrated narratives, experimental comics, autobiographical comics, minicomics (a specific format).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To tell stories visually, to practice comics craft, to publish work outside mainstream comics industry, to create personal or experimental work that wouldn't find commercial publishers.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Comic zines were part of the underground comix movement of the 1960s and '70s, and they've never stopped. Many successful cartoonists started in zines and still publish zine work. The form allows experimentation and personal expression that mainstream comics don't always support.</p>

    <h2>Fanzines (Topic-Focused)</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Zines about specific topics, fandoms, hobbies, or interests. The original meaning of "fanzine"—fan magazine about science fiction—expanded to cover any subject-focused zine. These are distinguished from other types by their focus on a topic rather than on personal expression, politics, or art.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common topics:</strong> Science fiction and fantasy, specific TV shows or movies, crafts and DIY projects, cooking, travel, sports, hobbies, subcultures, or truly anything people are enthusiastic about.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To connect with other fans, to explore topics in depth, to share expertise or enthusiasm, to create content about things mainstream media undercovers or ignores.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Fanzines are often collaborative, with multiple contributors writing about a shared interest. They build community around specific topics and create spaces for deep nerdery that would bore or confuse general audiences.</p>

    <h2>Travel Zines</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Zines documenting travel experiences, whether that's backpacking through Europe, biking across America, or just exploring your own city with fresh eyes. They combine personal narrative with place-based observation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common elements:</strong> Travel narratives, observations about places, photos or illustrations of locations, practical travel tips, reflections on dislocation and discovery, maps and guides.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To process travel experiences, to share discoveries, to create records of journeys, to inspire others to travel, because travel transforms experience into stories.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Travel zines often blur into perzines—the travel becomes a frame for personal narrative. The best travel zines avoid tourist clichés and instead offer genuine observation and insight about places and the experience of being a stranger.</p>

    <h2>How-To and Informational Zines</h2>

    <section class="type-entry">
        <h3>What They Are</h3>
        <p>Zines that teach skills, share knowledge, or provide practical information. They're instructional rather than expressive, though the best ones have personality alongside their utility.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common topics:</strong> How to make zines (very meta), cooking and recipes, gardening, bike repair, survival skills, DIY projects, political organizing tactics, harm reduction, really anything teachable.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why people make them:</strong> To share useful knowledge, to demystify skills, to make information accessible outside commercial or institutional channels, to build capacity in communities.</p>
    </section>

    <p><em>Stolen Sharpie Revolution</em> is the canonical example—a zine teaching you how to make zines. How-to zines often come from activist or DIY communities where skill-sharing is part of the culture. They're practical, but the decision to share knowledge freely rather than monetize it is itself political.</p>

    <h2>Hybrid and Experimental Zines</h2>

    <p>Most interesting zines don't fit neatly into categories. A zine might be part perzine, part political analysis, part art project. Another might be a comic that's also a travel zine that's also literary. The experimental impulse in zine culture means people constantly push against genre boundaries.</p>

    <p>Some zines are format experiments—pop-ups, fold-outs, unusual shapes, interactive elements. Some are conceptual projects—a zine that's all lists, or all found text, or assembled entirely from other zines. The freedom of the format encourages experimentation.</p>

    <section class="footnote">
        <strong>Footnote on Genre Evolution:</strong> These categories aren't fixed. New types emerge as culture changes. In the 2010s, "mental health zines" became a distinct subcategory as more people made zines specifically about navigating depression, anxiety, trauma, and recovery. "Queer zines" have always existed but coalesced into a more defined genre. "Ecology zines" are emerging as climate consciousness grows. The taxonomy of zines reflects the concerns and identities of their makers.
    </section>

    <h2>What Type Should You Make?</h2>

    <p>The honest answer: whatever type you want, or no particular type at all. Don't start with a genre and try to fit your content into it. Start with what you want to say or make, and let the genre emerge from that.</p>

    <p>That said, looking at different types can inspire ideas. If you didn't know travel zines were a thing, maybe that's what you want to make. If you thought zines were only about punk music, learning about literary zines might open possibilities. Understanding the landscape helps you see where you might fit or where you want to carve out new territory.</p>

    <p>The best advice: make the zine you want to read. If you wish a certain kind of zine existed, make it. Don't wait for someone else to create it. That's literally the point of DIY culture—if you want something, make it yourself.</p>
