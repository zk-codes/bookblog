                            <p>This dystopian nightmare ends like one, but I swear I was better for it.</p>

                            <p>In England, 2022, 1.2 million human-sized rabbits have taken over thanks to a mysterious event that happened 55 years ago. When a family of rabbits moves to Much Hemlock, a small village in Middle England, the villagers want them gone. Peter Knox and his daughter Pippa, however, choose to stand with them - even if it means risking the wrath of the UK Anti-Rabbit Party. Will Peter and Pippa have to choose between their human and rabbit friends?</p>

                            <p>Meet Yossarian, an extraordinary bombardier stationed in Italy during WWII. He's determined to stay alive even as thousands of people try to kill him and his own army keeps upping the number of missions he must fly. But there's Catch-22. If Yossarian tries to avoid these missions, he's considered sane and, therefore, ineligible to be relieved. Will Yossarian find a way out?</p>
