                    <h3>Financial Statistics &amp; Key Datapoints: How well is Barnes and Noble doing?</h3>
                    <p>Barnes &amp; Noble generated a total revenue of $3.5 billion in the fiscal year of 2020. This is a decrease of 6.6% compared to the previous year, which had a revenue of $3.8 billion.</p>
                    <p>They reported revenue of $3.48 billion in its 2019 fiscal year, down from $3.66 billion in 2018. Between 2012 and 2019, the company&#8217;s revenue dropped by nearly two billion dollars.<sup>[<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273460/revenue-of-barnes-und-noble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>]</sup></p>
                    <p>The net increase in cash for the fiscal year ending on April 30, 2019, was $64 million​.</p>
                    <p>Barnes &amp; Noble&#8217;s net income for the fiscal year of 2020 was $10 million. This is a significant decrease of 93.1% compared to the previous year&#8217;s net income of $146 million. The decrease in net income can be attributed to the decrease in revenue and increased expenses related to COVID-19 safety measures.</p>
                    <p>The company&#8217;s e-commerce sales increased by 32% in the fiscal year of 2020, compared to the previous year. This increase can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many consumers to shop online rather than in-store. Currently, only about 10% of Barnes &amp; Noble&#8217;s sales come from e-commerce.<sup>[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/arts/barnes-noble-bookstores.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a>]</sup></p>
                    <p>As of June 2021, Barnes &amp; Noble has closed 63 stores across the United States. The company has also opened 4 new stores in the same time period.</p>
                    <p><strong>What&#8217;s The Barnes And Noble Market Share?</strong></p>
                    <p>In the book store industry, they account for approx 26.6% of the market share.<sup>[<a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/us/company/barnes-noble-inc/8661/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5</a>]</sup></p>
                    <p><strong>Impact Of The Pandemic</strong></p>
                    <p>There has been a significant increase in book sales during the pandemic, with Barnes &amp; Noble reporting double-digit sales growth this year compared to 2019, before the Coronavirus outbreak​​. The chain is seeing a surprising surge in sales from teenagers. Sales of graphic novels at Barnes &amp; Noble are up by as much as 500%​​.</p>
                    <p>Across the US industry, book sales are up 12 percent through August this year compared to the same period a year ago. They’re up 20% from 2019 over the same time period​. The current double-digit growth in book sales has not been seen since Amazon​​.</p>
                    <p>Barnes &amp; Noble has undergone changes under new management. These changes include an interior overhaul of the chain’s 600-plus stores, and a management philosophy that empowers local bosses to decide which books they’ll stock, and a move away from its signature green color scheme​​. Despite having fewer stores (605 compared to 628 in 2019), Barnes &amp; Noble’s total sales are up around 6 percent from 2019​​.<sup>[<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/19/covid-has-sparked-a-book-craze-and-barnes-noble-is-cashing-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8</a>]</sup></p>
                    <p>The chain plans to open 12 stores in February and March alone. Some of these stores will be about a quarter the size of the typical 25,000 square foot location. This shows the chain can now generate the same volume from an 8,000 square foot store as a 25,000 square foot store.</p>
                    <p>Barnes &amp; Noble’s sales growth is driven by increased foot traffic in stores, not online sales.</p>
                    <p>Publishers are noticing the turnaround effects, with better store layouts, recommendations, refreshed selections, and lively merchandising and display. This leads to increased sales​​. Barnes &amp; Noble swapped out large rectangular tables that hold stacks of books for smaller round ones that encourage browsing and buying​​.</p>
