            <p id="top" class="p-summary dropcap">Hi! I'm <a href="https://zacharykai.net" rel="noopener">Zachary Kai</a>, maker of Road Less Read. It's a book blog, review log, literary recommendation resource, and eventual zine-o-pedia. Here's how it works:</p>

            <section>

                <!-- How It Works -->
                <ul>
                    <li>Find something you <strong>actually</strong> want to read, <em>fast</em>. No distractions.</li>
                    <li>Only books that've become pieces of my soul. Nothing bad or worse, mediocre.</li>
                    <li>Classics, obscure finds, bestsellers, new releases... Books as bridges. To ideas, culture, change.</li>
                    <li>My recommendations? Short, sharp, and useful.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>I've been reading since...I started forming memories. Perhaps the library's best customer as soon as I graduated from picture books, they've been my favorite place in the world since.</p>
                    <p>I'm Australian, and ridiculously lucky and proud of our libraries. Go support yours! Get a card!</p>

                    <p>I've been tracking the books I've read since late 2019, and it's one of the best habit-forming decisions I've made. Not just so I don't have unexplainable bouts of dejavu! So I can provide useful book recommendations to friends, family, and you, but also memories. The person who read the book I just finished isn't the one that's reading the one in-progress now, and a still different one will read the next one. Books as bridges, back to our previous lives.</p>
